      <b>Are there rules about submissions and comments?</b>
      <p>

      <p>
        <b>How are stories ranked?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a story
        was submitted. Comments in threads are ranked the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software,
        software which demotes overheated discussions, and moderator
        intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How is a user's karma calculated?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Roughly, the number of upvotes on their stories and comments minus the
        number of downvotes. These don't match up exactly; some votes are
        dropped to prevent abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why don't I see down arrows?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no down arrows on stories. They appear on comments after users
        reach a certain karma threshold, but never on direct replies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What kind of formatting can you use in comments?</b>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How do I submit a question?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Use the submit link in the top bar, and leave the url field blank.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do I make a link in a question?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't. This is to prevent people from submitting a link with their
        comments in a privileged position at the top of the page. If you want to
        submit a link with comments, just submit it, then add a regular comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b id="cflag">How do I flag a comment?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on its timestamp to go to its page, then click the 'flag' link at
        the top. There's a small karma threshold before flag links appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Are reposts ok?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a story has had significant attention in the last year or so, we kill
        reposts as duplicates. If not, a small number of reposts is ok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don't delete and repost the same story. Deletion is for things
        that shouldn't have been submitted in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Are paywalls ok?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's ok to post stories from sites with paywalls that have workarounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        In comments, it's ok to ask how to read an article and to help other
        users do so. But please don't post complaints about paywalls. Those are
        off topic.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <b id="ring">Can I ask people to upvote my submission?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        No. Users should vote for a story because they personally find it
        intellectually interesting, not because someone has content to promote.
      </p>
      <p>
        HN's software penalizes submissions, accounts, and sites that break this
        rule, so please don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Can I ask people to comment on my submission?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, for the same reason. It's also not in your interest, because HN
        readers will figure it out, flag the thread, and use unkind words like
        'spam'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Can I post a job ad?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Please don't post job ads as submissions to HN.</p>
      <p>
        A regular "Who Is Hiring?" thread appears on the first weekday of each
        month (or Jan 2). Most job ads are welcome there. But only an account
        called
        <a href="submitted?id=whoishiring">whoishiring</a> is allowed to submit
        the thread itself. This prevents a race to post it first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another kind of job ad is reserved for YC-funded startups. These appear
        on the front page, but are not stories: they have no vote arrows,
        points, or comments. They begin part-way down, then fall steadily, and
        only one should be on the front page at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why can't I post a comment to a thread?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Threads are closed to new comments after two weeks, or if the submission
        has been killed by software, moderators, or user flags.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In my profile, what does showdead do?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you turn it on, you'll see all the stories and comments that have
        been killed by software, moderators, or user flags.
      </p>
      <p id="cvouch">
        If you see a [dead] post that shouldn't be dead, you can vouch for
        itâ€”when enough users do this, the post is unkilled. Click on its
        timestamp to go to its page, then click 'vouch' at the top. There's a
        small karma threshold before vouch links appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In my profile, what is delay?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It gives you time to edit your comments before they appear to others.
        Set it to the number of minutes you'd like. The maximum is 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In my profile, what is noprocrast?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a way to help you prevent yourself from spending too much time on
        HN. If you turn it on you'll only be allowed to visit the site for
        maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between. The
        defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20
        minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours.
